  <td align="left">Web Application</td>
  <td align="left">Proficient</td>
  <td align="left">I specialize in crafting user-friendly, full-stack web applications. In the front-end, I leverage CSS to ensure a seamless and enjoyable user experience. The application boasts a diverse array of technologies, and I've implemented protected routes tailored to user roles. Notably, the web application remains fully functional even when not connected to the API. The API is well structured, with each part of the API separated into its own file. This keeps the back-end safe, maintainable and easily scalable.<br><br>
